"""
The MDR library has been developed to simplify use, reduce workflow overhead, and allow generalisability by restructuring the MDR algorithm into an open-source, platform-independent, python based library for model based registration in quantitative renal MRI.

The prototype MDR algorithm (Tagkalakis F, et al. Model-based motion correction outperforms a model-free method in quantitative renal MRI. Abstract-1383, ISMRM 2021) was initially developed using Elastix for co-registration and validated for renal T1-mapping, DTI and DCE against groupwise model-free registration (GMFR). The prototype MDR algorithm has been restructured and extended into the MDR_Library to provide a simple and intuitive application programming interface using ITK-Elastix.
